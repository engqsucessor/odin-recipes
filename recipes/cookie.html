    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love cookie butter! I was able to find a way to make cookie butter cookies. I could not find any recipe that used cookie butter, so I am glad I can share this recipe with the world.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup cookie butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. Mix flour, egg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the butter mixture creating a cookie dough. Roll dough into teaspoon-size balls.</li>
      <li>Spread 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow dish. Roll dough balls in the sugar to coat and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. Press dough balls with a fork twice to flatten slightly and press a crosshatch shape into the top of the cookies.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
